                       During our meet the pandas activity, you will be able to feed our panda cubs. They are very friendly,
                       playful and full of energy. Feeding them is one of the task, while you will get to play with them and 
                       watch them in their natural habitat. The experience is very touching as you get to be part of nature
                       but also highly educational.

                Pandas are adored by the world and thought to be a national treasure in China. With a black and 
                white coat, they mainly live in temperature forests high in moutains of Southwest China. This is 
                where they feast on bamboo entirely. An average of how much bamboo they intake would be around 26 
                to 84 pounds per day depending on which part of the bamboo they are eating. Their enlarged wrist 
                bones function as their opposable thumbs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat other vegetation, 
                fish, or small animals, but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets. Pandas eat fast, they
                eat a lot, and they spend about 12 hours a day just eating. To stay healthy, they have to eat
                a lot—up to 15 percent of their body weight in 12 hours—so they eat fast. You will be able to see 
                just how fast and much pandas are able to eat and will be able to do eating competitions with our
                famous panda Lulu.

                An adult female panda weighs 200 pounds. Pandas can climb as high as 13,000 feet and are also very good 
                swimmers. Sometimes male pandas relax by doing handstands against trees.Pandas are shy; they don't 
                venture into areas where people live. This restricts pandas to very limited areas. But don't worry as 
                our pandas love meeting new people and will most likely be holding your hand and showing you around their 
                home.

                The activity is safe and fun for both parties as our specialist will help you get comfortable with the pandas
                and also help you find your perfect panda to spend the day with.
