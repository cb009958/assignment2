                    promotes conservation by breeding certain rare and endangered species through proper animal welfare.

                    <h4>Petting the animals</h4>
                    <p>We believe that a zoo shouldn't just be looking at animals but instead to interact and make friends with
                        each other.
                        Our petting the animals program ensure safety of the visitors and animals. All fun with baby girffes, lion cubs 
                        and more.

                    <img src="./images/meet_tiger_main.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Did you know that tigers are on the brink of extinction? the largest population of tigers is in India which is home to 
                        half the wildcats. We ensure that our tigers are safe and to their best health state they can be at.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>    
                        Tigers are very important to the ecosystem  as they are one of the top predators in the food chain. Tigers help keep our
                        habitats balanced by preying on other animals, mainly herbivores. However, too many herbivores could  lead to overgrazing 
                        and degradation of the ecosystem.
